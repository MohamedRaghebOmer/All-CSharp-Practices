# All-CSharp-Practices

## Description

This repository is dedicated to all my C# and .NET Framework practice projects. Each individual project is included as a **submodule**. Every submodule contains its own `README.md` explaining the specific project.

## Structure

* Each practice project will be added as a **submodule**.
* Submodules will have their own folders and individual README files.

## How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
   ```
2. To update submodules:

## Notes
